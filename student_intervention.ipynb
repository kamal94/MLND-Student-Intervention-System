Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  \n",

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ensemble Method, Random Forest\n",
    " * *Usage*: One usage I could find for decision trees is in the [video game industry](https://www.quora.com/What-companies-or-industries-use-random-forests-for-data-analysis).\n",
    " * *Strengths*: Like most ensemble methods, the random forest approach enhances our chances in avoiding overfitting. A random forest avoids overfitting by having many 'weak learner' decision trees vote on a particular classification for a data point.\n",
    " * *Weaknesses*: Unlike a single decision tree where the results are interpretable from looking at the decision path that the tree took, a random forest is less interpretable because its result is a mixture of multiple decisoin trees. Fruthermore, it can take a long time to test/predict a single data point instance, since many decision trees need to be run and their results voted on.\n",
    " * I believe this is a good model to use because most of our features are categorical and can therefore have a simple decision line separation between them. Since decision trees are good at making decision boundaries between categorial data, we can use random forests to have many decision trees and reduce their chances of overfitting to the training data by relying on the enemble method. This algorithm would be a poor choice if the features were mostly continously numerical in nature.\n",
    " \n",
    "2. Gaussian Naive Bayes\n",
    " * *Usage*: [Naive Bayes could used in spam detection and classifying a written piece/webpage according to topics.](https://www.quora.com/In-what-real-world-applications-is-Naive-Bayes-classifier-used) Their usage in Natural Language Processing is driven by the probabilistic nature of language assumptions (the probability of \n",
    " * *Strengths*: This is a simple machine learning model, which means that the assumptions used are not beyond reason, and that the results and predictions of the model are easily interpretable.\n",
    " * *Weaknesses*: This model requires a large, representative sample of the population to be able to provide accurate predictions to unseen data. This is due to the statistical nature of this model. A larger sample of data points gives us a more confident representation of the original population.\n",
    " * I believe this is a good model to use because the absense or presence of a (categorial) feature should add to a statistical measure of how much a student needs intervention. If enough of these features add up to above a threshold, then the model should be predict that a student needs intervention.\n",
    " \n",
    "3. Decision Tree\n",
    " * *Usage*: Decision trees are used in Natural Language Processing and loan decision in banks, among other uses.\n",
    " * *Strengths*: Decision trees are a simple and intuitive algorithm whose answers can be interpreted rather easily by following the decision line that the tree took to reach its conclusion.\n",
    " * *Weaknesses*: Decisions trees are prone to overfitting. Pruning is one procedure to reduce the chances of overfitting. It works by removing leaf decisions that fail to reach a certain information gain threshold. However, pruning leads to a worsening of training error, and can not guarantee an increase in performance in test accuracy.\n",
    " * I belive this is a good model to ues because most of the data that we have is categorial, which lends itself well to this algorithm. Furthermore, the decision to have an intervention can be done by deciding on each category and then seeing what options we are left with, which is exactly what a decision tree does.\n",

    "**Answer: ** I would highly recommend the Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier (GNB) in this case. The GNB performs very favorably amongst other classifiers, providing both a higher testing F1 score, and a faster testing time than most other classifiers. The model is also fairly fast to train, faster than both decision tree and random forest classifiers. It also appears to not overfit the data, as can be seen from the training set F1 score(0.79-0.81), while the Decision Tree and Random forest implementations tended to overfit the training data as their F1 score on the training set was almost perfect (0.9833-1.000).  This results in a higher F1 score performance for the GNB (0.7-0.76) than both the Decisoin Tree (0.57-0.67) and the Random Forest (0.65-0.76) classifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the Random Forest classifier comes close to the score of the GNB, I would not recommend attempting to improve the Random Forest classifier because it is easy to see how it is greatly overfitting the data by notivcing the F1 score during trainning (0.98-0.99). "

    "  * Unfortunately, although [documentation says otherwise](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.naive_bayes.GaussianNB.html), the Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier implementation in sklearn does not accept any parameters at construction time, making it inaccessible to fine-tunning. Therefore, we will use our second best optimizer, the random forest classifier to fine tune. If this fine-tunned classifier performs better than GNB, we will report it as the best classifier.\n",
    "  * Fine tunning the random forest: There are many parameters that can be fine tunned with the random forst approach. The following is a list of the ones that are tuned blow:\n",
    "    * criterion: this decides which split criterion to follow. As we learned from Michael and Chris, entropy is about information gain, while gini works in another, but efficient, way.\n",
    "    * max_features: this controls the maximum number of features that each decision tree in the forst can leverage at any given time when splitting the data. The functions passes calculate the number of maximum features from the number of total features given. This helps increase the speed performance of the trees by limiting how many features to calculate split gain for.\n",
    "    * max_depth: this limits the number of splits allowed in each decision tree. This is used to control overfitting!\n",
    "    * min_samples_split: in this context, passing a floating point indicates passing a probabilty that must be satisfied (equal or higher) when splitting the input at any given node.\n",
    "  * We run the grid search 5 times to observe the variation in the result"

    "The fine tunned model performs much better than the untuned model. It tends to perform about 10% better on F1 score than the untuned model. However, it seems that there is variation in the results of what is the best parameter for min_samples_split and max_features numberes. Since max_features is more geared towards speed performance, we disregard this, since the optimization is constrained by the f1 score, not the speed. However, the min_samples_split parameter controls the threshold for which to make more splits in the data. It shows a range of variation from 0.3 to 0.7. This is an interesting side effect of the optimization.\n",
